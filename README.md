# React + Vite + ThreeJS Portfolio

This project is aimed to learn substantial JS skills and develop a personal portfolio. 
The video being followed to create such a portfolio can be found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkowOdMjvYo).

## Design Idea

Currently my main entertainment outlet has been Baldurs Gate 3 - As I keep getting sinking more hours in this game I am realising that I enjoy tabletop games and have gained particular interest in D&D.
Hence, throughout this portfolio I would like to place a heavy emphasis on my likings towards this.
The Idea Currently:

The video I am following showcases a rotating Island, instead of an Island we utilise a D20 Dice and perhaps simulate a rolling effect per page.
D&D elements such as different mythical races might be implemented (unsure as of how yet), whilst also utilising typical D&D gear such as weapons and armor.
To start 3D Models will be obtained from Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com) - However, realising the limited availability of certain downloadable structures that I would like to use/see - A part of this repository might be towards learning 3D Object Creation.
